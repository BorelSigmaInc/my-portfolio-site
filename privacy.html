            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Zi-US ("we," "us," or "our"). We operate the zi-us.com website (the "Service"). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our Service and outlines your privacy rights under various global regulations.</p>
            <p>This policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>Our principle is to collect as little user information as possible. As this is a static informational website, our data collection is limited to automatically collected Usage Data.</p>
            <h3>Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
            <p>We do not require you to create an account or provide any direct personal information to use our Service. We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, phone number, or physical address.</p>
            <h3>Information Collected Automatically ("Usage Data")</h3>
            <p>When you visit our website, our hosting provider (Vercel) may automatically collect certain anonymous information. This may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your device's IP address (often anonymized).</li>
                <li>Browser type and version.</li>
                <li>The pages of our Service that you visit.</li>
                <li>The time and date of your visit, and the time spent on those pages.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is used in an aggregated form for analytical purposes to help us understand how visitors engage with our site and to improve its performance and security.</p>

            <h2>3. Use of Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
            <p>We use cookies and local storage to operate and improve the Service.</p>
            <h3>What are Cookies?</h3>
            <p>Cookies are small text files stored on your device. They help websites remember information about your visit. For detailed information, please refer to our Cookie Policy section below.</p>
            <h3>How We Use Cookies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Essential Functionality:</strong> We use `localStorage` (a similar technology) to remember your consent to our cookie policy. This is necessary for the site to function in compliance with privacy laws.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>How to Control Cookies</h3>

            <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the limited, anonymous data we collect for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide, maintain, and secure our Service.</li>
                <li>To analyze usage and improve the user experience.</li>
                <li>To monitor the performance and health of our infrastructure.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The legal basis for processing this anonymous Usage Data is our legitimate interest in operating and improving our website.</p>

            <h2>5. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have specific rights regarding your personal data under laws like the GDPR (for residents of the EEA/UK) and the CCPA/CPRA (for residents of California). We have summarized these rights below for transparency.</p>
            <h3>Rights under GDPR (for EEA/UK Residents)</h3>

                <li><strong>The right to object</strong> to our processing.</li>
                <li><strong>The right of restriction.</strong></li>

            </ul>
            <h3>How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>

The primary way to control this data is by managing your cookie settings as described in Section 3. If you have any privacy-specific concerns, please contact us.</p>
            
            <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
            <p>The security of your data is important to us. We use industry-standard practices and rely on the robust security measures of our hosting provider, Vercel, to protect our Service.
